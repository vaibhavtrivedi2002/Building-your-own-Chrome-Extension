Due to the complexity of the extension, providing the entire codebase is impractical. However, here's a breakdown of the starting code with key functionalities:

**1. Manifest.json:**

This file defines the extension's metadata and functionalities. Here's a basic structure:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Programming Practice Companion",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Generate coding practice based on webpages",
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage"],
  "content_scripts": [{
    "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
    "js": ["content.js"]
  }],
  "browser_action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  }
}
```

**2. content.js:**

This script runs on every webpage and analyzes the content.

```javascript
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(request, sender, sendResponse) {
  if (request.message === "analyzePage") {
    const keywords = ["python loop", "javascript function", etc.]; // Add your keywords here
    let foundConcepts = [];
    for (const keyword of keywords) {
      if (document.body.innerText.toLowerCase().indexOf(keyword) !== -1) {
        foundConcepts.push(keyword);
      }
    }
    sendResponse({concepts: foundConcepts});
  }
});
```

**3. popup.html:**

This defines the user interface for the extension popup.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Practice Companion</title>
  <script src="content.js"></script>  </head>
<body>
  <h1>Practice Question</h1>
  <p id="question"></p>
  <button onclick="getQuestion()">Generate Question</button>
  <script src="popup.js"></script>
</body>
</html>


**4. popup.js:**

This script interacts with the content script and displays the question.

```javascript
document.getElementById("getQuestion").addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const concepts = await chrome.storage.local.get("concepts");
  // Logic to generate question based on concepts (replace with your implementation)
  const question = "Write a function to reverse a string"; // Example question
  document.getElementById("question").innerText = question;
});
```

**Note:** This is a very basic implementation. Here's what needs further development:

* **Concept Identification:** Refine the logic in `content.js` to use regular expressions or NLP for more accurate identification.
* **Question Generation:** Implement logic in `popup.js` to generate different question formats based on the identified concepts.
* **Customization:** Allow users to define supported languages and difficulty levels through the extension settings.
* **User Interface:** Enhance the popup UI to display the question clearly and provide options for hints or solutions.

Remember, this is just a starting point. Building a robust extension requires ongoing development and refinement. You can find resources on Chrome extension development and NLP libraries online to further enhance this concept.
